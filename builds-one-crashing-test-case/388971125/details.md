- **Overview**: The problem is related to the fact that there is cast to String in the test case, but it is not allowed to cast the object Priority to a String. This generates the exception.

- **Reason why the patch has been generated**: jKali managed to create a patch because the crashing test case is a rotten green test. Since the code-removal patch removed a property from the tested object and since the test checks the property only if the object has the property, this is the reason why the program with the code-removal patch passes all test cases.

- **Useful information for the developer**: Since the code-removal patch removes a specific property from the object, she can investigate if the value of the property is correct or not.
