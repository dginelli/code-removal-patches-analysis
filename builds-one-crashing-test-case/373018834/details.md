- **Overview**: the `OutOfMemoryError` occurs during the execution of the method `toString()` in which it uses a `StringBuilder` for a custom object `DependencyQueue`.

- **Reason why the patch has been generated**: The code-removal patch generated by jKali is able to avoid the throw of the exception, preventing the program from going out of memory during the creation of the String, but it works because the test suite is weak. Indeed, the change applied by the code-removal patch influences the result of the method `findPredecessor()` to find the predecessor of an item in the queue in an incorrect way, but there are not test cases to check if the representation of the `DependencyQueue` is correct or not. Thus, adding an assert that checks the output of the method `toString()` of the class `DependencyQueue`, would prevent the code-removal patch from working.
